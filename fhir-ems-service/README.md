The contents of this directory is a Spring Boot Java application that was bootstrapped using the Spring Boot Initializer.

## Development
To work on this application you will have to install maven on your local machine. At present, there is no need to add any custom global/user settings. To run the application locally, please do the following: 


1. ./deploy.sh

OR

You can run outside of container by: 

1. mvn clean install
2. java -jar target/nameofjar.jar


### TODO

Look into reincorporating maven-docker stuff
